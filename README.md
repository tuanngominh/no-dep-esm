# Goal
How does it look like when building an esm javascript todo app without `npm install` in backend and frontend. Just nodejs v22 and browser.

# Output
A sample todo app that can CRUD todo with images. Db could be a gsheet or in memory and persist to json file. Upload images store in local file system.

Ad hoc code for env, oauth2, json to csv, upload, routing, static content.
Unit test with node test.
